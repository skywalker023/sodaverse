## ü´ß CO<sub>3</sub>

### Environment setup

We recommend you create a conda environment as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

and activate it with

```bash
conda activate sodaverse
```

### Running CO<sub>3</sub>

```bash
python co3.py --display-frequency 1 --model gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 --run-id first-run-with-chatgpt
```
This command will automatically download Atomic10x and start running the CO<sub>3</sub> distillation to make SODA.
All files will be saved under the `data` directory, which will also be created during the run.

#### Running on other large language models (LLMs)

Currently, this repository only supports GPT models. However, you can add other LLMs to the `agents` directory. All you need to do is create an agent class with the method `interact()`.

## ü•§SODA

You can now load SODA from the [HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/soda) as the following:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("allenai/soda")
```

## üßëüèª‚ÄçüöÄCOSMO

You can now load COSMO-3B from the [HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/allenai/cosmo-xl).

### Have a chat with Cosmo!

> üö® <b>Disclaimer:</b> We would like to emphasize that COSMO is trained on SODA and ProsocialDialog mainly for academic/research purposes. We discourage using COSMO in real-world applications or services as is. Model outputs should not be used for advice for humans, and could be potentially offensive, problematic, or harmful. The model‚Äôs output does not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the authors and their associated affiliations.


#### Running Cosmo

By running the command below, Cosmo will be automatically downloaded and you can have a chat!

```bash
python chat_with_cosmo.py
```

#### Limitations

Cosmo is mostly trained on social chitchat. Therefore, we do not encourage having knowledge-intensive conversations (e.g., science, medical issues, law).
For detailed limitations, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10465).
